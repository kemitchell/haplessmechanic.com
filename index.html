      <h1>misfires inevitable</h1>
      <p>
        Any time it’s worth putting down a catch pan or bottle—for
        motor oil, brake fluid, fork oil, anything—it’s worth
        laying down a tarp to catch when you miss.

      <h1>The Big Squeeze</h1>
      <p>
        If you’re dumb enough to rebuild a master cylinder, bench
        test it before reinstalling on the bike.
      </p>
    </article>

      <h1>Trust, But Verify</h1>
      <p>
        As you remove parts, keep them in the same arrangement they
        had on the bike.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never assume that arrangement is correct.

      <h1>Anti-seize</h1>
      <p>
        Don’t forget to use anti-seize on stainless fasteners in
        aluminum threads.
      </p>
      <p>
        But don’t use too much.  That stuff gets all over everything.

      <h1>JIS</h1>
      <p>
        Don’t press your luck with crusty, old Japanese Industrial Standard screws.
        Replace with cap head screws as soon as you can.
      </p>

      <h1>Fuses</h1>
      <p>
        Always have spare fuses on hand.

      <h1>Rubber Nubbins from Hell</h1>
      <p>
        When rebuilding a Honda SOHC top-end, do not drop cam chain
        tensioner rubber into the sump.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you do, fish for it with a skinny, telescoping retrieval
        magnet.  Stick the magnet down the same hole through which
        the rubber fell.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you get tired of fishing, set the engine up over a drain
        plug and run litres of oil through it, over and over again,
        until the rubber plops out.

      <h1>Cleaner Cleaning</h1>
      <p>
        If you go to all the trouble to clean out a tank—EvapoRust
        works a treat—don’t forget to clean the cleaner out before
        filling up with gas and connecting to your carburetors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Motorcycles do not run well on rust remover.

      <h1>Twelve Point Pain</h1>
      <p>
        Do not use twelve-point sockets.  They are the Devil’s
        hand tools, and will strip your fasteners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buy and use six-point sockets.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h1>Blunt-Force Persuasion</h1>
      <p>
        Assume every fastener that you did not install, personally,
        within the last six months, will require 24 hours under PB
        B’Laster, the manual impact driver, and a 2-pound hammer.
