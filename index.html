      <h1>Magic Shiny Grabbers</h1>
      <p>
        Most really touchy problems stem from failures to work
        methodically.  The key to working methodically---for some
        utterly mysterious reason----is magnets.  Magnets on sticks.
        Magnets on strings.  Magnets in trays.  Magnets on tools.
        Do not forget about magnets.

      <h1>Sticky Widgets</h1>
      <p>
        Removing old fasteners is not like the old halftime
        staple---make the half-court shot, win a fabulous prize.
        It's more like baseball---a numbers game.  There is never
        just one sticky screw.  You might get lucky wacking away
        at this one with the impact straight off, but patience and
        penetrating oil make winning streaks.

      <h1>Whack-it-More</h1>
      <p>
        Check your manual impact driver after every unsuccessful hit.
        It may have reoriented itself to tighen your faster.

      <h1>Strange Potions</h1>
      <p>
        Wintergreen oil (methyl salicylate) and rubbing alcohol does
        indeed soften up hard rubber, like carb boots.  But don't
        expect to use softened pieces right away.  They swell pretty
        substantially in the dip, and you can do your own damage
        tightening then down while they're still oversized.

      <h1>Tool Blinders</h1>
      <p>
        No matter what tool you're using, if you stop feeling,
        listening, looking, smelling, and thinking about everything the
        bike is telling you while using it, you're better off without.
        The more spiffy, specialized, or "technical" the instrument,
        the easier it is to play dumb when it comes out.
      </p>

    <article>
      <h1>Identical Nothing</h1>
      <p>
        If there's more than one of it on the motorcycle---carb boots,
        fasteners, gaskets, whatever---make sure you keep it with
        its cousins when you take it off the bike.  New parts might
        be identical, but after forty years, not-so-new parts like
        to be where they've been.

      <h1>Stinks Like Stupid</h1>
      <p>
        Test everything you can on the bench before bringing
        combustible fuel into the picture.  Water, a vacuum pump,
        and a clean tube to blow in can answer a great many dangerous
        questions.

      <h1>Dissolving Shortcuts</h1>
      <p>
        Barryman's Chem-Dip ain't what it used to be---an acid.
        Even Pine-Sol ain't what it used to be---pine oil.
        Go to a shop where you live and ask how they clean parts.
        Do what they do.
      </p>

    <article>
      <h1>Seek Source</h1>
      <p>
        If it's not in the massive motorcycle parts catalog the shops
        use, it may not be what you want.  The K&amp;L catalog is
        your friend.

      <h1>Fluid Pedantics</h1>
      <p>
        You can pump the brake all you want.  Air wants to go up,
        and oil wants to go down.  Neither stubbornness nor patience
        will change these unalterable facts.

      <h1>Meat in the Head</h1>
      <p>
        Never apply brute force to any part you plan to reuse.
        You haven't solved the puzzle until you've found a way to
        get it done without fighting the bike.
      </p>
      <p>
        With very rare exception, everything on a 1970s Japanese
        motorcycle engine could be torn down and rebuilt by a savvy,
        anemic leprechaun with hand tools, no mechanical leverage.
        If it's hard because the bike is old, the answer is nearly
        always chemical---penetrating oil, solvent, degreaser---and
        rarely mechanical.  If it's hard because you don't know how
        it works, figure out how it works and do it a smarter way.

      <h1>Such a Tool</h1>
      <p>
        The best tool on the market won't help you do a job you
        don't understand.  Highly efficient tools hide what's
        being accomplished, and how.  Do it the simplest way first.
        You'll probably learn more.

      <h1>Access Denied</h1>

        Don't order a rebuild kit until you're sure you can take
        it apart.

      <h1>Room Temperature Valentine</h1>

        If you find RTV silicone where it shouldn't be, that isn't
        the only thing wrong with the motor.

      <h1>Toil Leak</h1>
      <p>
        Never install a gasket until you're sure what every hole is
        supposed to let through, and to where.  Installing gaskets
        with holes where they shouldn't be is not recommended.

      <h1>Reversible Wisdom</h1>
      <p>
        Anytime you want practice cleaning carburetors, reinstall your
        fuel line with the inline filter upside down.  All the junk
        you were smart enough to block with the filter will settle
        immediately in your jets.

      <h1>Misfires Inevitable</h1>
      <p>
        Any time it's worth putting down a catch pan or bottle---for
        motor oil, brake fluid, fork oil, anything---it's worth
        laying down a tarp to catch when you miss.

      <h1>The Big Squeeze</h1>
      <p>
        If you're dumb enough to rebuild a master cylinder, bench
        test it before reinstalling on the bike.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h1>Trust, But Verify</h1>
      <p>
        As you remove parts, keep them in the same arrangement they
        had on the bike.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never assume that arrangement is correct.

      <h1>Anti-seize</h1>
      <p>
        Don't forget to use anti-seize on stainless fasteners in
        aluminum threads.
      </p>
      <p>
        But don't use too much.  That stuff gets all over everything.

      <h1>JIS</h1>
      <p>
        Don't press your luck with crusty, old Japanese Industrial Standard screws.
        Replace with cap head screws as soon as you can.

      <h1>Rubber Nubbins from Hell</h1>
      <p>
        When rebuilding a Honda SOHC top-end, do not drop cam chain
        tensioner rubber into the sump.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you do, fish for it with a skinny, telescoping retrieval
        magnet.  Stick the magnet down the same hole through which
        the rubber fell.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you get tired of fishing, set the engine up over a drain
        plug and run liters of oil through it, over and over again,
        until the rubber plops out.

      <h1>Cleaner Cleaning</h1>
      <p>
        If you go to all the trouble to clean out a tank---EvapoRust
        works a treat---don't forget to clean the cleaner out before
        filling up with gas and connecting to your carburetors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Motorcycles do not run well on rust remover.

      <h1>Twelve Point Pain</h1>
      <p>
        Do not use twelve-point sockets.  They are the Devil's
        hand tools, and will strip your fasteners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buy and use six-point sockets.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h1>Blunt-Force Persuasion</h1>
      <p>
        Assume every fastener that you did not install, personally,
        within the last six months, will require twenty four hours
        under PB B'Laster, the manual impact driver, and a two-pound
        hammer.
