        As you remove parts, keep them in the same arrangement they
        had on the bike.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never assume that arrangement is correct.

        Don’t forget to use anti-seize on stainless fasteners in
        aluminum threads.
      </p>
      <p>
        But don’t use too much.  That stuff gets all over everything.

        Don’t press your luck with crusty, old Japanese Industrial Standard screws.
        Replace with cap head screws as soon as you can.

        When rebuilding a Honda SOHC top-end, do not drop cam chain
        tensioner rubber into the sump.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you do, fish for it with a skinny, telescoping retrieval
        magnet.  Stick the magnet down the same hole through which
        the rubber fell.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you get tired of fishing, set the engine up over a drain
        plug and run litres of oil through it, over and over again,
        until the rubber plops out.

        If you go to all the trouble to clean out a tank—EvapoRust
        works a treat—don’t forget to clean the cleaner out before
        filling up with gas and connecting to your carburetors.

        Do not use twelve-point sockets.  They are the Devil’s
        hand tools, and will strip your fasteners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buy and use six-point sockets.

        Assume every fastener that you did not install, personally,
        within the last six months, will require 24 hours under PB
        B’Laster, the manual impact driver, and a 2-pound hammer.
