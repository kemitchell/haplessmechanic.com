      <h1>In-Frame Cylinder Head Cover Pull</h1>
      <p>
        It's possible to pull a cylinder head cover and replace its
        oil seal and gasket without pulling the engine from the frame.
        The trick is to minimize tension on the camshaft by rotating
        the engine to minimum tension on the cam chain, as if you
        were resetting the chain tensioner, then pull the cam chain
        tensioner off the head and rotate the rocker arm pins to
        maximize tappet clearance.

      <h1>Cylinder Head Cover Gaskets</h1>
      <p>
        Widely available top-end gasket sets for the 350 pack two
        identical gaskets for left (points) and right (tachometer)
        cylinder head covers.  The orientation is important, especially
        on the right side, where the cam case has channels to pass oil
        from the cam case to the tachometer worm gear.  The left-side
        gasket can do without the extra hole, which ends up between
        solid aluminum on both mating surfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you put the right-side gasket in backwards, you will get
        a leak in the dark void below the cam case.  Which is right
        above the spark plug.  Where the oil will pool, then overflow
        and soak the cooling fins.

        UNI recommends model NU-4001 as a replacement for stock air
        boxes.  They fit under the original side covers.  They work.
