      <h1>Chain Guard</h1>
      <p>
        There is a welded-on bracket near where the swingarm meets the
        left case cover that keeps the chain guard away from the drive
        chain near the sprocket.  Make sure you slide the chain guard
        behind the outside of the left case cover and over the bracket.

      <h1>Cam Chain Tension</h1>
      <p>
        The difference between too little and too much tensioner
        pressure on the cam chain is a matter of well less than
        forty-five degrees' rotation of the adjustment screw.
        It's very fiddly.
      </p>
      <p>
        If "automatic" tensioning fifteen degrees past top dead
        center for cylinder one doesn't do it, Adjust the tensioner
        with the motor running.  A constant whirring sound indicates
        the tensioner is too tight, and is constantly applying hard
        pressure on the cham chain.  Constantly clacking as the cam
        chain slaps against the tensioner indicates insufficient
        tension.
      </p>
      <p>
        Snug the lock nut tightly.  Otherwise, the adjustment screw
        may move as the engine turns over.  It moves costantly without
        any lock nut pressure at all.

      <h1>Dyna S</h1>
      <p>
        The Dyna S kit is great, and comes with great instructions.
        I have just one tip.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the advance mechanism, not fine adjustments to the plate
        or pickup, to guide the timing process.  The goal is to have
        the ground-line test light switch on when fully advanced,
        and off as soon as you release even the slightest amount of
        tension from the rotor.
