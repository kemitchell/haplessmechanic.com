      <h1>Dyna S</h1>
      <p>
        The Dyna S kit is great, and comes with great instructions.
        I have just one tip.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the advance mechanism, not fine adjustments to the plate
        or pickup, to guide the timing process.  The goal is to have
        the ground-line test light switch on when fully advanced,
        and off as soon as you release even the slightest amount of
        tension from the rotor.
